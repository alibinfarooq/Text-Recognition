Code a peforms the operations of text recognition fro an image by processing it removes its noise adjusting its thresh hold and other image processing techniques. it takes the processed image and uses tesseract to extract text from it.

Code b aplies the boxing techniques to extract text from an image,encoded video or live video.PS this technique will be used in live video text rcognition.

Code c interprets the text in an image using the boxing technique

Code d performs the operation of recognizing the text from a live video using boxing technique.

for these modules you would need
VS code 
python for windows or python 3 for linux
pip3 
openCV librarires 
tesseract libraries
numpy libraries

as these modules were developed in linux the further provided instructions are for linux. For coders using windows these libraries and installers can be downloaded from intenet ,it's relatively easy.

for vs code installation:
sudo apt update
sudo snap install --classic code

for python3 installation:
sudo apt-get install python3

for pip3 installation:
sudo apt install python3-pip

for openCV libraries installation:
sudo apt install python3-opencv

for tesseract libraries installation:
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
